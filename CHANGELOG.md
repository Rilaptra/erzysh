### [2.4.16] - 2026-01-29

## [2.4.18] - 2026-01-29

## Eryzsh v2.4.18 (2026-01-29)

This build is primarily focused on hardening system stability and delivering performance improvements derived from our latest profiling cycle. Enjoy the lower latency.

### Added 🚀

*   Implemented the `ConfigMap` client for runtime parameter injection, allowing operators to push configuration updates to `Eryzsh-Core` without requiring a service restart. Hello, zero-downtime configuration.
*   New diagnostic endpoint `/system/vitals` added to the `Observer` service, providing granular visibility into queue backpressure and current thread pooling metrics.
*   Introduced comprehensive audit logging for all successful and failed operations against the `ACL Broker`.

### Changed ⚙️

*   **Vectorization Engine Optimization:** Applied significant low-level optimization to the Vectorization Engine (`VE-v4`). This change leverages explicit SIMD instruction sets, resulting in an observed 12% reduction in median processing latency across standard data sets.
*   Upgraded core system dependencies (gRPC, OpenTelemetry) to their latest stable releases, ensuring compatibility with upcoming infrastructure patches.
*   Refactored the internal payload deserialization pipeline to utilize synchronous processing where appropriate, reducing heap pressure during high-throughput ingestion spikes.

### Fixed 🐛

*   Resolved an insidious Scheduler deadlock that occurred intermittently when the global event queue exceeded 50,000 pending items during synchronized commit phases.
*   Patched a minor, non-critical memory leak discovered within the telemetry reporting module that would only manifest after 72+ hours of continuous operation.
*   Corrected an edge case where API tokens cached by the `Auth Gateway` would occasionally fail revocation checks if the initial token length was below 32 characters.
*   Fixed rendering issues in the internal Dashboard UI component when viewed on Safari (v17+). Apologies to the macOS crew.

## [2.4.17] - 2026-01-29

## [v2.4.17] - 2026-01-29

### ✨ Added

*   Implemented a dedicated `/health/liveness` endpoint strictly conforming to container orchestration standards, improving pod readiness detection reliability.
*   New verbose logging configuration added to the data synchronization layer, accessible via `ERYZSH_DEBUG_SYNC=true`.

### ♻️ Changed

*   **Performance:** Achieved a significant reduction in median p95 latency across the internal state serialization routines (~15% overall improvement via smarter buffer pooling).
*   Adjusted default throttling limits for all public API endpoints to better accommodate high-frequency bursts from core client applications.
*   Deprecated the use of SHA-1 hashing in favor of SHA-256 for internal signature validation contexts.

### 🛠️ Fixed

*   Patched a critical memory saturation issue within the primary data ingestion service that manifested after 72 hours of sustained uptime under maximum load.
*   Resolved an intermittent race condition that caused non-graceful shutdown failures when processing high-volume transactional queue backlogs.
*   Fixed a bug where service registration failed silently if the local configuration file contained trailing whitespace.
*   Ensured API key revocation procedures are now atomic, resolving an edge case where concurrency could lead to temporary validation bypasses.

### v2.4.16 (2026-01-29)

🌟 **Added**

*   **Tooling Migration (BiomeJS):** Introduced BiomeJS as the standard for code formatting and linting across the entire codebase. This move drastically simplifies our development setup and ensures stricter, high-performance consistency checks.

⬆️ **Changed**

*   **Dependency Overhaul:** Executed a major update of core development and runtime dependencies. This addresses several minor upstream security vulnerabilities and prepares Eryzsh for upcoming platform shifts in the Node.js ecosystem.

## [2.4.11] - 2025-12-28

## [2.4.13] - 2025-12-28

### v2.4.13 — 2025-12-28

### Added

✨ Implemented new telemetry probes to track and log internal query paths exceeding the 250ms execution threshold, greatly improving future diagnostic capacity.

### Changed

⚡️ Refactored the core `DataStream` serialization protocol, moving from Protocol Buffer v2 to v3 for ~7% latency reduction in high-volume inter-service syncs.

⚙️ Adjusted the default external resource health check timeout from 500ms to 750ms to accommodate expected network jitter in highly distributed zones.

### Fixed

🐛 Fixed a critical resource handle leak in the `SynapseResolver` queue scheduler, stabilizing shutdowns during high-volume persistence operations.

🔒 Patched an obscure edge case where concurrent write operations could temporarily bypass optimistic locking checks if scheduled via the legacy internal scheduler bridge. All relevant services are now required to use the atomic comparator.

## [2.4.12] - 2025-12-28

### v2.4.12 — 2025-12-28

This is a stability and performance patch focused on resource management and core agent resilience. We’ve tightened the concurrency model around the persistence layer, resulting in fewer lock contentions under heavy load.

---

### Added

*   ➕ Introduced `MEMORY_PRESSURE_THRESHOLD` configuration for the Ghost Agent nodes, enabling early warning telemetry hooks for critical memory consumption.
*   🛡️ Added support for structured, environment-driven data masking in core logging utilities, improving compliance capabilities in high-security production environments.
*   🔑 New CLI command: `eryzsh debug validate-schema`, allowing developers to locally verify data integrity schemas against the current database structure before deployment.

### Changed

*   ⚡ Optimized the internal `RequestScheduler` to dynamically adjust the worker thread pool size based on backpressure metrics. Initial testing shows an average reduction in queue latency by ~8%.
*   ⬆️ Updated dependency: Migrated internal networking utilities from `Cryo-Net v3.0.4` to the performance-enhanced `v3.1.0` SDK.
*   ⚙️ Refactored the core state management interface to strictly enforce idempotency guarantees on all write operations, simplifying error handling for downstream consumers.

### Fixed

*   🐛 Resolved a critical race condition within the `PersistenceManager` that could lead to a deadlock when flushing high-volume state updates simultaneously across multiple threads.
*   🐞 Fixed an intermittent bug where expired session tokens were not properly revoked from the distributed cache, consuming unnecessary memory resources.
*   🩹 Patched a vulnerability that allowed improperly formatted URI parameters to bypass input sanitation checks on the metrics endpoint. (Thanks to @security-researcher-104 for the report.)

### v2.4.11 (2025-12-28)

### Added

✨ **Runtime Introspection via CLI.**
Introduced `eryzshctl state inspect`. This new command provides deep-dive diagnostics into active session contexts and worker metadata, allowing engineers to troubleshoot live sessions without requiring a service restart or connection interruption.

### Changed

⚡️ **Scheduler Overhaul.**
The core asynchronous scheduler has been replaced, migrating away from the legacy thread-pool implementation. The new non-blocking executor substantially improves I/O bound throughput and has demonstrably reduced P95 latencies across high-volume services.

🛠️ **Configuration Migration.**
Default configuration schemas now strictly enforce TOML parsing for consistency and faster initialization. We have formally deprecated YAML input support for all core modules (`eryzshd`, `data-pipe`, `ghost-agent`). Please update your configuration files prior to v2.5.0.

### Fixed

🩹 **Crucial Memory Leak Patch.**
Addressed a significant, intermittent memory retention issue within the ephemeral worker pool of the Data Ingestion Pipeline (DIP). This leak specifically manifested under high-frequency, bursty load conditions, leading to unnecessary resource scaling events. Stability restored.

🐛 Adjusted internal `ghost-agent` timeout logic to correctly differentiate between connection failure and resource contention stalls. This eliminates false-negative disconnection reports during periods of peak internal backpressure.
